     * Starts a timer that increments the elapsed seconds every second.
     *
     * This function does the following:
     * 1. **Cancels any existing timer:** If a timer is already running (i.e., `timerJob` is not null),
     *    it is canceled to prevent multiple timers from running concurrently.
     * 2. **Launches a new coroutine:** A new coroutine is launched within the `viewModelScope` to
     *    manage the timer's execution. This ensures that the timer is tied to the lifecycle of the
     *    ViewModel.
     * 3. **Enters an infinite loop:** The coroutine enters a `while (isActive)` loop, which continues
     *    to run as long as the coroutine is active.
     * 4. **Delays for one second:** Inside the loop, `delay(1000L)` pauses the coroutine for one
     *    second (1000 milliseconds).
     * 5. **Increments elapsed seconds:** After the delay, `_elapsedSeconds.value++` increments the
     *    value of a mutable state (presumably a LiveData or StateFlow) representing the number of
     *    seconds elapsed.
     *
     * The timer will continue to run until one of the following occurs:
     * - The `viewModelScope` is cancelled (e.g., when the ViewModel is cleared).
     * - The `timerJob` is explicitly cancelled using `timerJob?.cancel()`.
     * - The coroutine's `isActive` flag becomes false for another reason.
     *
     * **Note:** This function assumes the existence of:
     *   - `timerJob`: A `Job` used to manage the timer coroutine.
     *   - `viewModelScope`: A `CoroutineScope` tied to the ViewModel's lifecycle.
     *   - `_elapsedSeconds`: A mutable state holder (e.g., MutableLiveData, MutableStateFlow)
     *     that stores the number of elapsed seconds.
